## Bridge.on(event, callback)
Bridge.on(event, callback) allows you to listen to events triggered by another plugin or the "bridge." editor itself. 
You may return a modified version of the object received inside the callback function.

### Built-in Events
| Events | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ```save``` | Triggers before "bridge." saves a file. |
| ```opened-sidebar``` | Triggers after a user switched sidebars. Callback receives the sidebar id |

### Example
```javascript
Bridge.on("save", ({ file, path, content }) => {
    if(file.split(".").pop().toLowerCase() == "txt") {
        return { content: content + "\nby solvedDev" };
    }
});
```
